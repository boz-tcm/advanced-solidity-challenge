# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06 Cohort`

## `Project: Module 21 Advanced-Solidity-Challenge`

## Background
> After waiting for years and passing several tests, we have been selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency (a fictitious organization) to become part of the first human colony on Mars.

## Purpose
> As a prominent fintech professional within this first human colony to Mars, we have been chosen to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new colony. We have decided to base this new system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)
>
>KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. We will launch a crowdsale that allows people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
