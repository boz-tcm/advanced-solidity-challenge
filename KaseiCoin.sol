    As part of the constructor definition, add a call to the constructor of the ERC20Detailed contract, passing the name, symbol, and 18 parameters.
    (Recall that 18 is the value for the decimal parameter.)

    Create a constructor for the KaseiCoin contract and have the contract inherit the libraries that you imported from OpenZeppelin.

    In the KaseiCoin contract, add a constructor with the following parameters: name, symbol, and initial_supply.

    "A constructor is a special method in any object-oriented programming language which gets called whenever an object of a class is initialized.
    It is totally different in case of Solidity, Solidity provides a constructor declaration inside the smart contract and it invokes only once when the contract
    is deployed and is used to initialize the contract state. A default constructor is created by the compiler if there is no explicitly defined constructor."
